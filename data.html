        <h2>Data I Worked With</h2>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience working with various large data types, including both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. This is a list of data which I found super interesting:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A longitudinal survey that tracks a cohort of individuals born between 1980-1984, providing extensive data on education, employment, family background, and life outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Includes detailed information on school enrollment, work experience, job transitions, income, training programs, household characteristics, and the ways individuals finance their college education (e.g., student loans, grants, and parental support).</li>
                    <li><strong>My experience:</strong> When linking each respondent’s education and employment information, it is crucial to first identify the specific educational institution or company they were associated with. 
                        The dataset structure requires additional steps to match these records accurately over time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the longest-running household panel surveys, making it invaluable for studying long-term economic trends.</li>
                    <li>Intergenerational data, useful for studying family-level dynamics and economic mobility over generations.</li>
                    <li><strong>My experience:</strong> It provides detailed information about risk behaviors such as smoking and drinking 
                        and unique information about gender perspectives. But you might want to be careful about the number of observations left for estimation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH 2022)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A cross-sectional survey that provides comprehensive data on children's health, well-being, family characteristics, and access to healthcare in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Includes detailed information on physical and mental health, developmental milestones, healthcare utilization, family dynamics, and social determinants of health.</li>
                    <li><strong>My experience:</strong> Many variables in NSCH 2022 are discrete, so when using this dataset, it is essential to consider whether the sample size is sufficient for identification.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A comprehensive dataset covering U.S. postsecondary institutions, providing detailed information on enrollment, tuition costs, financial aid, faculty characteristics, institutional finances, and student outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Includes longitudinal data on higher education institutions, allowing analysis of trends in tuition, graduation rates, and institutional characteristics across different time periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>My experience:</strong> IPEDS can be linked with NLSY97 geocode data using the UNITID number to obtain detailed educational institution information for each respondent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
